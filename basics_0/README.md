# Networking Basics #0

This project is designed to introduce the fundamental concepts of networking, focusing on key topics such as the OSI model, different types of networks (LAN, WAN, Internet), MAC and IP addresses, as well as TCP and UDP protocols. It's a great opportunity for beginners to familiarize themselves with the networking world and understand how data is transferred from one point to another in a computing environment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the OSI Model, its organization, and the purpose of each layer.
- Differentiate between LAN and WAN, their typical usages, and geographical sizes.
- Understand what the Internet is and how it operates.
- Identify the types of IP addresses, their significance, and the need for IPv6.
- Understand the difference between TCP and UDP protocols and their usage.
- Know what a port is and the significance of ports like SSH (22), HTTP (80), and HTTPS (443).
- Use tools/protocols like `ping` to check network connectivity.

## Prerequisites

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your Bash script files must be executable and adhere to best practices (commenting, no errors with shellcheck, etc.).
- A basic understanding of Unix/Linux commands.

## Tasks

### 0. OSI Model

- Understand and explain the OSI Model and its significance in network communication.

### 1. Types of Networks

- Differentiate between various types of networks (LAN, WAN, Internet) and understand their characteristics.

### 2. MAC and IP Addresses

- Explain what MAC and IP addresses are and their role in identifying devices on a network.

### 3. UDP and TCP

- Understand the differences between TCP and UDP protocols and know when to use each.

### 4. TCP and UDP Ports

- Learn common ports and their uses, and how to check for listening ports on a system.

### 5. Is the Host on the Network?

- Use the `ping` command to check connectivity with another device on the network.
